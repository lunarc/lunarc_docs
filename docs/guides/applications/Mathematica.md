Mathematica is a computational software program used in many scientific, engineering, mathmatical and computing fields.

## Starting Mathematica on COSMOS
Mathematica is gui based and likely to consume significant resources such as CPU time and/or memory.  Resource intensive Mathematica sessions must not be started on the login nodes.  We recommend starting Mathematica as an on-demand application using the [graphical application launcher](../../../getting_started/gfxlauncher).  
You get a gui similar to:

## Licensing
LUNARC does not have a Mathematica license.  To use Mathematica on COSMOS, you have to bring your own license.

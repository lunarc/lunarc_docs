# Mathematica
Mathematica is a computational software program used in many scientific, engineering, mathmatical and computing fields.

## Starting Mathematica on COSMOS
Mathematica is gui based and likely to consume significant resources such as CPU time and/or memory.  Resource intensive Mathematica sessions must not be started on the login nodes.  We recommend starting Mathematica through the [HPC Desktop On-Demand](../../getting_started/gfxlauncher).

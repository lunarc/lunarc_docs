# Creating a password for your account

When your account has been created at LUNARC you can create a password using the password self service portal. Identify yourself with your email address and the mobile phone you have registered in [SUPR](https://supr.snic.se/person/). No password is required.

The password change takes immediate effect. You may also check if you have a full [active pocket pass token](https://lunarc-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authenticator_howto/#checking-the-validity-of-your-token) registered.

If this fails, phone LUNARC support on +46 (0)46-222 4454 from your registered mobile phone. Additional questions will be asked to verify your identity.

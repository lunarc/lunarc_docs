# Creating a password for your account

First, make sure that you have applied for a LUNARC account. If a project proposal or membership request on LUNARC resources has been approved, or if you have been proactively added to a project at LUNARC by the PI, your [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se/person/) profile page should give you the option to apply for a LUNARC account under the Accounts section.

When your account has been created at LUNARC you can create a password using the password self service portal. Identify yourself with your email address and the mobile phone you have registered in [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se/person/). No password is required. If, upon entering your email, you get an error message say "Check your details to complete the login" and there are no typos, you should check that you have requested a LUNARC account and that it was approved.

The password change takes immediate effect. You may also check if you have a full [active pocket pass token](https://lunarc-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authenticator_howto/#checking-the-validity-of-your-token) registered.

If this fails, phone LUNARC support on +46 (0)46-222 4454 from your registered mobile phone. Additional questions will be asked to verify your identity.

Identify yourself with your email address and the mobile phone you have registered in [SUPR](https://supr.snic.se/person/). No password is required. If this fails, phone LUNARC support on +46 (0)46-222 4454 from your registered mobile phone. Additional questions will be asked to verify your identity.

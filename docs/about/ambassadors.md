# LUNARC HPC Ambassadorship

Our HPC Ambassadors are a diverse group of expert users with a broad collective experience of all aspects of research using LUNARC resources. They have a broad grasp of when and how to put LUNARC resources to use in their particular field of research, including where future research will likely be directed. This makes them suitable for helping other researchers and students looking for direction and suggestions as to how to put LUNARC resources to use in their research.

Our HPC Ambassadors are not support staff. For support regarding LUNARC resources and applications, please
